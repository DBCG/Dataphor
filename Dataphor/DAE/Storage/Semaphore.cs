		Note regarding semaphore implementation ->
			The traditional method of implementing a shared semaphore of this type involves using
			Interlocked.CompareExchange.  This method would have worked (although I have questions
			about the implementation of such an operation given an argument larger than an int) but
			it required that a queue of waiting threads be built, which is traditionally accomplished
			using a pointer in the process block or TLS, but I could not find a way, even in the
			win api to access another threads TLS, only your own.  Given the impossibility of 
			implementing a simple linked queue using TLS, and the arguable efficiency of CompareExchange
			on arbitrary size objects, I opted for the built-in lock construct (critical sections) to
			protect the semaphore during the Acquire and Release methods.
