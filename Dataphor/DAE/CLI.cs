	/*	
		Defines the Call Level Interface (CLI) to the Dataphor Server (DAE).
		If the Dataphor Server instance is in-process, the IServerXXX interfaces can be used to
		communicate directly with the instance.  If the Dataphor Server is running in another process,
		the IRemoteServerXXX interfaces can be used to communicate directly with the
		instance.  In either case the IServerXXXBase interfaces designate functionality 
		that is common to both.
		
		In-Process
		The classes that implement the actual Dataphor Server implement both the IServerXXX and 
		IRemoteServerXXX interfaces.  In process, the IServerXXX interfaces provide
		more efficient access to the Dataphor Server.
		
		Out-of-Process
		The IRemoteServerXXX interfaces are optimized for network usage.  
		The LocalServer classes implement the IServerXXX interfaces to provide
		transparent access to a Dataphor Server running in another process.  These classes wrap
		the IRemoteServerXXX interfaces exposed by the out-of-process Dataphor Server.  They also
		perform transparent data and schema caching to optimize access to the Dataphor Server.
		
		Overall Architecture
		The overall architecture of the CLI follows the following basic structure ->
		
			Server -> 
				Represents the Dataphor Server instance. Provides access to the highest level
				functionality, such as starting, stopping and connecting to the Dataphor Server instance.
				
				IServerBase, IServer and IRemoteServer are the interfaces implementing this level
				of the CLI.
				
			Session ->
				Represents a channel for communication with the Dataphor Server.  User authorization and
				SessionInfo settings are tied to the session.  Provides functionality for
				starting and stopping a Dataphor Server process.
				
				IServerSessionBase, IServerSession, and IRemoteServerSession are the interfaces
				implementing this level of the CLI.
				
			Process ->
				Represents a running process in the Dataphor Server.  All transaction support is tied to
				the Process.  Provides functionality for participating in transactions in the
				Dataphor Server, as well as preparing scripts, statements and expressions for 
				execution in the Dataphor Server.
				
				IServerProcessBase, IServerProcess, and IRemoteServerProcess are the interfaces
				implementing this level of the CLI.
				
			Plan ->
				Represents a compiled plan ready for execution in the Dataphor Server.  Provides interfaces
				for executing the plan, as well as opening a cursor against the process.
				Only one plan may be executing at a time in a single process.
				
				There are two types of plans, Statement plans and Expression plans.  Statement
				plans represent the execution of a single statement where there is no result, such
				as an Insert, Update, Delete, or statement block, or where no result is desired.
				Expression plans represent the execution of single expression returning a result
				set.  This may be a select statement, or simply a table expression.  The select
				statement is used by the CLI when processing scripts to determine whether a
				given batch is an expression.  It is not required to prepare an expression.  For
				example, the strings "select Employee" and "Employee" would both be valid arguments
				to the PrepareExpression methods.
				
				IServerPlanBase, IServerPlan, IServerStatementPlan, IServerExpressionPlan,
				IRemoteServerPlan, IRemoteServerStatementPlan, and IRemoteServerExpressionPlan are
				the interfaces implementing this level of the CLI.
				
			Cursor ->
				Represents an open cursor executing in the Dataphor Server.  Provides interfaces for navigating
				on the cursor, and for performing updates against the data it contains.  Also implements
				the proposable interfaces.
				
				IServerCursorBase, IServerCursor and IRemoteServerCursor are the interfaces implementing
				this level of the CLI.
				
			Script ->
				Represents a prepared script, ready for execution in the Dataphor Server.  A script consists of
				a set of batches, each of which may either be a statement or expression.  A script
				is parsed only, not compiled.  Each batch of a script is compiled separately and
				executed.  In this way the effects of a batch on the Dataphor Server will be available to
				subsequent batches.
				
				Scripts are processed by first parsing the entire script, then returning each top-level
				statement as a batch.  Each batch can then be executed sequentially.  If a batch contains 
				a select statement, it may also be opened as an expression.
				
				IServerScriptBase, IServerScript, and IRemoteServerScript are the interfaces implementing
				this level of the CLI.
			
			Batch ->
				Represents a prepared statement or expression within a prepared script.  Provides
				functionality for executing the batch, or for opening a cursor if it is an
				expression.
				
				IServerBatchBase, IServerBatch, and IRemoteServerBatch are the interfaces implementing this
				level of the CLI.
				
		The Classes that implement these interfaces in the Dataphor Server are re-entrant in the sense that only
		one thread is allowed to be active in a given server, session or process at a time.  All attempts 
		to access the interface from another thread will be blocked until the current thread has completed 
		execution.

	/* HACK: We have discovered that while remoting, some types of complicated nested structs are not able to be
	 * passed through the remoting layer.  A fix up error is given.  MOS noticed that there are at least two
	 * different errors that can be received.
	 * One case is where a struct contains an array of a different struct
	 * in which that struct has an array of a native data type (or more complicated than this).
	 * The other case is when a struct contains a struct which contains an enum.  This is a case in our system.
	 * To overcome this bug, in two of our structs below, the enums were replaced with bytes (for they both fit in
	 * a byte) and in the places that they are referenced they are cast from enum to byte or vice versa.
	 * This bug was reported to microsoft, and should be fixed in version 1.1 of the framework.
