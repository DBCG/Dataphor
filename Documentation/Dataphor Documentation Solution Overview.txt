This document provides an overview of the Dataphor Documentation solution which is used to author and build the Dataphor documentation.

Authoring:

The Dataphor Documentation is authored in DocBook format, using the 4.3 version of the DocBook DTD.

There is an XMetal rule set that can be used to provide WSYWIG editing on top of the content files, but for this round of updates,
strict XML authoring is being used for simplicity.

The root XML content document is DataphorSet.xml. This document lists all the sub-entities that are included in the documentation.

Building:

Building the Dataphor documentation is accomplished through a series of batch files, described in the DocBuild\bat\readme.txt file.
