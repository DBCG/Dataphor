	 <para><symbol>browse</symbol> is the parser recognized symbol for this
		  operator. The <symbol>browse</symbol> keyword is very powerful. The
		  <symbol>browse</symbol> keyword can be used anyhere an <symbol>order</symbol>
		  can be used. The <symbol>browse</symbol> clause does what the
		  <symbol>order</symbol> does and more. In addition to <symbol>order</symbol>
		  capabilities an index is included. When searching on a browsed column, the
		  cursor goes immediately to the requested row and the cursor is opened from that
		  point to the end of the query. It is not limited to forward cursor motion. If
		  an attempt is made to go backwards on a browsable cursor from the original
		  point of search, then the DAE recognizes this and the cursor actually swaps
		  directions and is accessible to the opposite direction.</para>
